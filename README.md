# Application-scoring-model

This repository contains my application scoring project
## Goal
Build an interpretable credit scoring model to predict default risk and compare different modeling approaches.

## Data
Two datasets are used:
- Approved applications (appbeh_approved.xlsx) — includes target default flag.
- Rejected applications (appbeh_rejected.xlsx) — used for rejected analysis and comparison.

## What was done
### 1) Data sanity checks 
### 2) Feature engineering
### 3) Baseline model
### 4) Rejected applications analysis
### 5) Alternative approaches


## How to run
1. Open the notebook in Jupyter / Colab.
2. Put the data files in the same folder (or update paths inside the notebook).
3. Run cells from top to bottom.
